Title: Hierarchical Bayesian Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Robot Navigation in Uncertain Environments
Abstract: Mobile robot navigation in dynamic environments with moving obstacles presents fundamental challenges: robots must make real-time decisions under uncertainty while avoiding collisions with unpredictably moving agents. Traditional reinforcement learning approaches suffer from poor sample efficiency and inability to handle uncertainty, while hierarchical methods lack principled uncertainty modeling.
 We propose a novel Hierarchical Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (HRL-BRL) framework that integrates principled Bayesian uncertainty modeling with hierarchical task decomposition for mobile robot navigation. Our approach maintains probabilistic beliefs over dynamic obstacle behaviors using conjugate Beta distributions, updates these beliefs through Bayesian inference, and employs Thompson sampling for exploration within a three-level hierarchical structure: high-level goal-seeking, mid-level static obstacle avoidance, and low-level dynamic obstacle avoidance.
 Comprehensive experimental validation in simulated environments demonstrates significant performance improvements.Experimental validation demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods, with our approach achieving substantially higher success rates and path efficiency compared to standard hierarchical and reactive baselines. The framework demonstrates effective transfer learning and human-like navigation behavior while maintaining computational efficiency.
 Our contributions include: (1) the first integration of Bayesian uncertainty quantification with hierarchical reinforcement learning specifically designed for dynamic navigation, (2) mathematical formalization with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive validation including human-likeness assessment and transfer learning evaluation, and (4) demonstrated robustness across varying environmental complexities. The open-source implementation enables reproducible research and practical deployment in real-world navigation scenarios.
